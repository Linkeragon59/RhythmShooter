###Game's rules:

Choose your weapons in the Weapon's shop, and play.

This is a mix between a Shooter game and a Rhythm game, when you perform well on the Rhythm game, your spaceship becomes stronger in the Shooter game.

The challenge is to play two different games at the same time to survive and get stronger, until the boss appear...

###Game's controls:

- Move the ship with the arrows of the keyboard.
- Tap on the [1],[2] and [3] keys (respectively for the left, middle and right tiles) in rhythm with the beats of the music. (If you don't have [1,2,3] keys, you can use [q,w,e] or [a,s,d].)
- Tap on [p] to pause/unpause.
- Tap on [o] to use/stop the AI that controls the ship in the shooting game.

###To do list:

- Add/Finish to create more ennemies
- Add/Finish to create more stages
- Improve the AI (make it able to learn to avoid enemies' laser)
- Improve the functioning of the "Reset Save" of the title.
